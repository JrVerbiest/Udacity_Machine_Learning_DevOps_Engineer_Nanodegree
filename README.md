# Udacity Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree

Build DevOps skills required to automate the various aspects and stages of machine learning model building and monitoring.

## Projects

### Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code

In this project, you will implement your learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI). This project will give you practice using your skills for testing, logging, and coding best practices from the lessons. It will also introduce you to a problem data scientists across companies face all the time: How do we identify (and later intervene with) customers who are likely to churn?

### Build an ML Pipeline for Short-term Rental Prices in NYC

Students will write a Machine Learning Pipeline to solve the following problem: a property management company is renting rooms and properties in New York for short periods on various rental platforms. They need to estimate the typical price for a given property based on the price of similar properties. The company receives new data in bulk every week, so the model needs to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating a reusable pipeline. The students will write an end-to-end pipeline covering data fetching, validation, segregation, train and validation, test, and release. They will run it on an initial data sample, and then re-run it on a new data sample simulating a new data delivery.
